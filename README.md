# GEO419A
This project was created as part of the Geo 419A - Modular Programming in Remote Sensing: Python Part I module at Friedrich Schiller University Jena by *Panagiotis Koutsikos* and *Gerasimos Papakostopoulos* and is supervised by *Prof. Dr. Christiane Schmullius*, *Martin Habermeyer*, and *Marco Wolsza*.

The aim of this work was to develop a functional and reproducible application that downloads, extracts and visualises a SAR scene from a zipped folder from a given URL. This could be successfully implemented by using the programming language Python and the following libraries:
- Numpy (v. 1.21.5)
- GDAL (v. 3.0.2)
- Rasterio (v. 1.2.10)
- Requests (v. 2.28.1)
- Matplotlib (v. 3.5.3)
